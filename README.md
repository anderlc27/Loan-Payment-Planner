# LoanPaymentPlanner
This is a payment planner created to give the user a starting plan for paying off student loans. This program will accept user input and output a plan for paying the loan.

## Technical Description
Originally a C++ project, I continued my learning of the p5.js library and created this application. This application takes user input and outputs a suggested payment plan based on the expected salary and how much of said salary to put towards the payments.

## Project Background
This project came about when I wanted to figure out how long (hypothetically) it would take for me to pay off my student loans if I was hired right out of college. This project overall was simple conceptually, however, I gained further exposure to JavaScript and found that it helped me think in a more broader spectrum as a programmer.
